TODO
====

 * Remove all `using namespace` declarations from .h / .tcc files

 * Filesystem, socket, HTTP libraries, exposing Task/TaskStream factories.

 * Write a coding standard, and make the code fit it (currently very inconsistent).

 * Parallel promise stream, i.e. one which can run the consumer multiple times
   concurrently.
